Even with METEOR_ALLOW_SUPERUSER or --allow-superuser, permissions in your app
directory will be incorrect if you ever attempt to perform any Meteor tasks as
a normal user. If you need to fix your permissions, run the following command
from the root of your project:

  sudo chown -Rh <username> .meteor/local

[[[[[ /home/warren/nastia/test/arcadia_web ]]]]]

=> Started proxy.
=> Started MongoDB.
=> Started your app.
